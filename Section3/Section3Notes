HTML is a markup language. There is no logic present in HTML. It's just about marking up a document. 
It was built to indicate to web broswers what how text should be formatted.

To write in HTML, we pick from a set of elements and tags to format text.

Use MDN (Mozilla Documentation Network) for reference when struggling.

Use <p></p> to group together elements in HTML.

Use h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 to seperate content in your webpage. Make sure to only use one h1.

HTML5 Boilerplate is an HTML, CSS and JavaScript template for creating HTML5 websites with cross-browser compatibility.

<!DOCTYPE HTML> declares that the document is a HTML5 document.
The <html></html> tag represents the root (high-level) content of an HTML document. One <head></head> element and one <body></body> are permitted inside this tag.
The <head></head> tag represents back-end metadata which will never be exemplified to the end-user. Inside this element is the <title></title> element, which displays the title of the tab in a web browser.
Typing "!" and tab will automatically create a boilerpplate in an HTML document.

Numbered lists are called ordered lists (<ol></ol>) and bulleted lists are called unordered lists. (<ul></ul>)
