MongoDB is the most popular dev-end database in the world. Databases can handle large amounts of data efficiently, store it compactly, access it effieciently, and offer general security methods to secure data. 
Databases also generally scale well.

Structured Query Language (SQL) databases are relational databases, meaning one must pre-define a schema of tbales before they insert anything.
Non-SQL databases do not use SQL; there are many types of non-SQL databases, including document, key-value, and grph databses. 

MongoDB is a document-oriented database, meaning they store documents that store data in some format. 

Mongo is commonly used with Node and Express, works particularly well with JS, and as a result, a strong Mongo dev community is present.

Use the use command in mongosh to use a certain database. Use the show command to show the status of the database one is currently using. 

BSON is binary JSON. Mongo stored JSON objects as BSON.

Collections in MongoDB are groups of documents. 

Use db.collection.insertOne(), db.collection.insertMany(), and db.collection.insert() to insert documents into a collections.

_id is an identification string created by default by MongoDB.

Use db.collection.find({key: value}) to find all documents in a collection with value 'value' of key 'key'.

Use db.collection.updateOne({key: value}, {$set: {key1: value1}}) to set 'key1' to 'value1' for the first object with 'value' assigned to 'key'.

Use db.collection.updateMany({key: value}, {$set: {key1: value1}}) to set 'key1' to 'value1' for all objects with 'value' assigned to 'key'. One can also set newly created keys using this. 

Use db.collection.updateOne({key: value}, {$set: {key1: value1}, $currentDate: {lastChange: true}}) to set lastChanged of a certain object to the current date.

Use db.collection.deleteOne({key: value}) to delete the first object where 'key' is set to 'value'.

Use db.collection.deleteMany({key: value}) to delete all objects where 'key' is set to 'value'.

Use db.collection.deleteMany({}) to delete all objects.

Dollar sign operators allow one to define more specific arguments when CRUDing.
