The client terminal takes some getting used to, but it has the potential to be MUCH more efficient than using a GUI. It provides access to areas of our computer that we normally cannot interact with. 
Many webdev tools are utilized and instelled via the command line. 

A terminal is a text-based interface to a computer. The shell is the software running on the terminal. Bash is one of the most popular shells (this is the default used on any Mac).

Use 'ls' to display the contents of one's user folder (stands for list). Use 'pwd' (stands for print working directory) toprint a path to the current working directory (the one you are currently navigating).
Use 'cd' to move between folders (laterally or into a sub-branch). Use 'cd..' to move into a super-branch.

A relative path to a file is textually relative to the file/folder that the termial is currently navigating, and absolute path is a path textually containing every super-branch one needs to traverse from the base folder (hard-drive) of the computer to get to the desired location. 

Use 'cd../..' to traverse a super-super-branch of the current directory one is traversing. Use 'cd ~' to start traversing the "home" directory. 

Use 'mkdir' to create a new directory (separate directory name with spaces to create multiple directories).

Use 'man' to display the documentation of your terminal. Use '[command] -[flagGlyph]' to change the qualities and return values of a command in various different fashions. 

Use the 'touch' command to create a file with the file name follwing the command.

Use the 'rm' and'rmdir' command to permanently delete a file or empty directories, respectively.
