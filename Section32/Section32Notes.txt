Node.js follows the CommonJS module system, and the builtin require function is the easiest way to include modules that exist in separate files. 

The basic functionality of require is that it reads a JavaScript file, executes the file, and then proceeds to return the exports object.

By default an imported file returns an export value of {}. One can change this by assigning a value to module.exports. 

If one requires an entire directory, that export value will be the 'index.js' file in that directory. 

NPM is a library of packages for devs to use and a command line tool to access and manage those packages. 

use the '-g' flag to install a package globally.

'package.json' is a file present in every node package containing metadata about the project (dependencies, autors, licenses, etc.).

Use 'npm init' to create a 'package.json'.

If one delcares the command 'npm install' when the directory containing a 'package.json file' is selected, all specified dependencies will be installed.
