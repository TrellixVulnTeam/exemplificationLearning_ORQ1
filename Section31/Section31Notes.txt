Node.js is a JS runtime that allows one to execute code outside of the browser. With Node, we can write back-end and server-side code with JS.

One can also build command line tools, video games, and native applications with Node.

The JS console is one's browser is a REPL. One can type code in, and it will Read, Evalulate, Print something, and Loop it. REPLs are continual programs; until one types something in, they continually wait for input.

The Node REPL is similar to the web browser REPL, except with additional features, such as built-in modules. However, one does not have access to DOM APIs and windows and documents when using Node. 

The global scope in Node is accessed using an object called 'global'.

Use the 'node [fileName]' command to run a JS file in the Node REPL.

'process' is an object residing in the global scope that provides info about, and control over, the current Node.js process.

'process.argv' returns 'process.execPath'm command line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched, and the absolute path to the JS file being executed.
