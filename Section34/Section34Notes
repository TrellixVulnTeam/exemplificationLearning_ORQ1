Templating allows one to define a preset "pattern" for a webpage that can be dynamically modified. 

res.render() allows one to render a template page as a repsonse to a HTTP request.
Use path to make sure that the /views and /public folder accesses is static and isn't changing as one moves to various directories. 

Various tags exist in EJS to inform the compiler that some code is not HTML.

One can pass data from a JS file (or from a database) to a EJS file using object parameters.
app.get("/rand", (req, res) => {
    const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
    res.render("random", {rand: num});
});

<h1>Rnadom number: <%= rand %></h1>

Make sure not to use the equals sign in an EJS tag when including conditionals in a tag.

Use app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public"))) to delcare an absolute location for static objects (CSS stylesheets, images, Bootstrap JS, etc.).

Use <%- include("partials/head.ejs") %> to link the contents of a header/navbar/footer/any element to a template header/navbar/footer/any element.
