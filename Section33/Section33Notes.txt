Express is a web framework for Node.js. It helps developers initiate servers to listen for requests, parse incoming requests, match requests to particular routes, and craft one's HTTP response and associated content. 

When one uses a library, they are in charge; they control the flow of the application code, and they decide when to use the library. 
With frameworks, that control is inverted. The framework controls the application, one writes their code according to the syntax of the framework.

Express applications require a port on which they listen to inputs. 

'localhost' is a reference to one's current machine, and the number follwing it and a colon is an address to indentify the server.

app.use() defines code that will be exeucted when an Express server gets a request. This function accepts one parameter (a callback containing parameters of a request object and response object).

One cannot have an HTTP request that gets more than one response.

app.get() defines code that will be executed when an Express server gets a request a specific route ("/route").
