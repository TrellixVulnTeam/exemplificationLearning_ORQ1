Functions are reusable procedures which allow for a reduction in the duplication of code on a high-level basis. One has to actually define (write) a function before running in a program.

Function syntax in JS: 
function funcName(args, args) {
    statements; 
}

Arguments in JS are inputs to a function. 

The code immediately following the 'return' keyword is returned by the function; it is the output of the function. 
The 'return' keyword also terminates function execution.
