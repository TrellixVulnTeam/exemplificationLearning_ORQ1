The internet is a bunch of connected devices (tablets, mobile devices, thermostats, computers, video game consoles). 

Imagine two computers that want to communicate with each other. They use a cable at first. If six more computers want to be connected in that same room, many more wires are needed. 

If billions of computers watned to be connected, this situation would be completely infeasible. As a result, the internet utilizes routing where there are physical devices who have teh job of connecting one computer to another.

Individual machines are identified through IP (internet protocol) addresses.
