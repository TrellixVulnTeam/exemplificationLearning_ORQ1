AJAX stands for Async JS And XML. It refers to making requests to a server while a page is already loaded. 

API stands for Application Programming Interface; defines interactions between softwares. Most APIs are Web APIs; these are liek portals into a different application, database, or dataset. 

Web APIs are interfaces occurring over the HTTP protocol, request-response system of endpoints.  

JSON is the format in which most Web APIs respond to requests. This stands of JS Object Notation. Every key and value in a JSON object is a string, except if a value is a number

One can use JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() to convert JSON to JS object and vice versa, respectively.

Postmand and Hoppscotch are tools used to call HTTP requests, test out APIs, and save requests.     

The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. 
These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently.

HTTP status responses include 1** (information responses), 2** (successful responses), 3** (redirection messages), 4** (client-side error), 5** (server-side error).

One can append query strings to URLs to assign values to certain parameters. A query string always starts with a question mark and key-value paris are separated by ampersands. 
Query strings are ignored by APIs unless hard-coded in. 

HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.

XHR or XMLHttpRequest is the original method of sending JS requests.

The Fetch API is a newer version of making HTTP requests via JS; it also supports Promises. fetch() returns a Promise, which, when resolved, returns a ReadableStream.
fetch().json() also returns a Promise, which returns JSO when resolved.
